 ## Description 
 - The purpose of this application is to allow each user to: add the applicable department, roles, names, and salaries. The application also allows the user to update and delete each employee, as needed. 
    This product uses node, inquirer, and MYSQL in a harmonious, little-coding-triangle.
 
 ## Usage
 - In order to follow the guide for this project, one must follow the intended prompts, and add their team members as appropriate. When the user runs node index.js into their terminal, the prompts and lists will begin, allowing the user with full-choice of their options.
